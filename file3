DSCM allows developers to work offline and independently on their local copies of the repository, giving them the freedom to experiment and make changes without affecting the central codebase.
With DSCM, developers can share changes directly with each other without relying on a central server, enabling more efficient collaboration, especially in distributed or remote teams.
